## Concept

```{r Q}
#reading check 2
quiz(
  caption = NULL,
  #Q1
  question("Q1) What is the name of the theoretical framework for data visualization that is the foundation of the ggplot2 package?",
    type = "learnr_text",
    answer("the grammar of graphics", correct = TRUE),
    answer("grammar of graphics", correct = TRUE),
    answer("layered grammar of graphics", correct = TRUE),
    answer("the layered grammar of graphics", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    incorrect = "Submitted"
  ),
  question_wordbank(paste("Q3) Drag and drop the variables to match the aesthetics they are mapped onto in Figure 2.1", htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_02_1.png", height = 400, width = 700) ),
          choices = c("x","size",  "color", "y"),
          wordbank = c("GDP per Capita", "Population", "Continent", "Life Expectancy"),
          answer(c("GDP per Capita", "Population", "Continent","Life Expectancy"), correct = TRUE), 
        allow_retry = TRUE,
        incorrect = "Submitted")
)

```

## Application

Construct a scatterplot of `eruptions` by `waiting` using the `faithful` dataset by filling in the blanks (the data is already preloaded in R).

```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  ____
```
