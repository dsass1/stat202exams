## Application

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of RStudio Cloud if needed.

### Application 1

Construct a scatterplot of `height_inches` by `num_followers`. Set the `color` equal to `personality`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

Describe the relationship AND answer whether or not you are surprised by the relationship.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 7)
```

### Application 2

Let's determine if North campus, South campus, or off campus students (Neither) attend more parties. Don't include First year students because they are new to school and may not know people yet.

In other words,

- exclude student's that have `school_year` of "First year"
- compute the average (mean) of `num_party` by `campus_housing`.
- Print the results in ascending order (low to high).

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


### Application 3

Construct a histogram of `salary` using the `survey` dataset. Choose an appropriate number of bins and change the border color to "white".

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = survey, mapping = aes(x = )) +

```

Compute any appropriate summary statistics that will help in the description of the plot.

```{r App3-calc, exercise=TRUE}

```

Describe the histogram, including the center, spread, and shape.

```{r App3-describe}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data


You are welcome to open the dataset in RStudio Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `num_followers` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"

## Bonus

```{r bonus}
question_blank(
  "In our daily class slides, we use the same dataset for all of our examples. What is the name of the dataset?",
  answer(c("penguins"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  style = "exam",
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```
