## Application

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of RStudio Cloud if needed.

### Application 1 (5 points)

For our class (fall 2022), we want to see if there is a relationship between the age a student thinks they will marry and their height.

First, subset the dataset `survey` to only include the `quarter` equal to "fall 2022". Store this in `survey_fall`.

Then use `survey_fall` to construct a scatterplot of `height_inches` by `marry`. Set the `color` equal to `love_first_sight`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}
survey_fall <-
  
ggplot(data = survey_fall)

```

Describe the relationship between `marry` and `height_inches` AND answer does it appear that students who believe in love at first sight will get married younger than those that do not?

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

### Application 2 (3 points)

Using the `survey` dataset... 

- compute the `mean` and `sd` of `num_followers`
- make sure you print/output the results

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Application 3 (3 points)

Using the `survey` dataset...

- subset the dataset to only contain the columns: `quarter` and `height_inches`
- create a new variable called `height_feet` which is computed as `height_inches`/12
- make sure you print/output the results

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Application 4 (4 points)

Let's determine if people who `smoke_weed` are happier.

Use the `survey_party` dataset created below. This removes the NA values and and removes the student's who "Don't know" whether or not they are happy.

Now, construct a barplot of `happy` with `fill` equal to `smoke_weed`. 

The counts will distort this interpretation so set the `position` argument that will represent a **proportion** (ie: all bars should be filled to the top at 1).

```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}
survey_party <- survey %>% 
  filter(!is.na(smoke_weed), happy != "Don't know")


```

Based on the barplot, conclude if this leads you to believe that people who smoke weed are happier.

```{r App4-describe}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in RStudio Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `num_followers` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"
- `marry` -- "At what age do you think you will marry?" (In the case, missing response indicates that student had no plans for marriage.)
- `smoke_weed` -- "Do you smoke weed? (Yes, No, Occasionally)" (Missing responses means the question was not asked that quarter)
- `exercise` -- "Approximately, how many minutes do you spend exercising per week?"
- `love_first_sight` -- "Do you believe in love at first sight?"
