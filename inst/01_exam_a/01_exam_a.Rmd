## Application

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This contains the responses to the questions you answered on day 1 of class. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of RStudio Cloud if needed.

### Application 1

Construct a scatterplot of `salary` by `height_inches`. Set the `color` equal to `gender_ident`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

Describe the relationship AND answer whether or not you are surprised by the relationship.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 7)
```

### Application 2

Let's determine if happier people or sad people go to more parties for our quarter.

In other words,

- Consider only the `fall 2022` quarter. 
- Compute the average (mean) of `num_party` by `happy`. 
- Print the results in descending order (high to low).

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Application 3

Construct a histogram of `num_followers` using the `survey` dataset. Choose an appropriate number of bins and change the border color to "red".

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = survey, mapping = aes(x = )) +

```

Compute any appropriate summary statistics that will help in the description of the plot.

```{r App3-calc, exercise=TRUE}

```

Describe the histogram, including the center, spread, and shape.

```{r App3-describe}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in RStudio Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `num_followers` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"

## Bonus

```{r bonus}
question_blank(
  "In our daily class slides, we use the same dataset for all of our examples. What is the name of the dataset? ___",
  answer(c("penguins"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  style = "exam",
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
